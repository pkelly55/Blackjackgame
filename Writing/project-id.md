TEAM 6 - Peyton Kelly 

Project idea:

For my final project I would really like to build a blackjack game. This is because growing up it was always my favorite card game. Blackjack would be a good final project because it will use all types of the things we have learned throughout this semester. My ideas for the game, it will have a betting where the user starts with x number of chips and if they win they will be payed out accordingly such as blackjack pays 5 to 1 and beating the dealer pays 3 to 2. These can be done using inputs and certain data structures. This game i would also like to have certain things like if blackjack is dealed out twice in a row there could be things said from the dealer. Just to add a bit of humour and make it a little more realistic.
