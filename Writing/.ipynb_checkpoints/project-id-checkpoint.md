TEAM 6 - Peyton Kelly 

Project idea:

For my final project I would really like to build a blackjack game. This is because growing up it was always my favorite card game. Blackjack would be a good final project because it will use all types of the things we have learned throughout this semester. My ideas for the game, it will have a betting where the user starts with x number of chips and if they win they will be payed out accordingly such as blackjack pays 5 to 1 and beating the dealer pays 3 to 2. These can be done using inputs and certain data structures. This game i would also like to have certain things like if blackjack is dealed out twice in a row there could be things said from the dealer. Just to add a bit of humour and make it a little more realistic. 

The data structures I plan to use will be a dictionary and lists this way i will be able to store the types of cards and be able to incorporate highs and low aces. The dictionary will hopefully be used as a sotrage for the cards used and then allow for resetting. 

My class setups will probably be for setting the certain decks and generating the cards using the randoms one for the dealer and user. One class that I need to make will be for the dealer to whether to hit or stand. This will be with the ints because the dealer must stand at 17 or higher. 

For my inheritence I will probably use separate classes for gambling part, user, and dealer. Then I will have the final as class blackjack sort of how the checkout was. This will be to call and run the entire program through one py file and keeping things small.
